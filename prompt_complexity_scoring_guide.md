# Prompt Complexity Scoring Guide

## Foundational Questions (1-3 Points): Factual Recall and Basic Comprehension
These questions are typically direct and brief, requiring the recall of basic facts or a simple understanding of a single, specific concept.

### 1 Point: Direct Factual Recall
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Common knowledge or a single, isolated piece of information.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** No reasoning required; direct recall.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** None.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Highly concrete; no abstract concepts.
*   **Example:** "What is the capital of China?"

### 2 Points: Simple Conceptual Description
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Requires an explanation of a single concept or definition.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** None, or only a single, very simple associative step.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** None.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Concrete, involving a few common terms.
*   **Example:** "What is photosynthesis?"

### 3 Points: Information Integration and Classification
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Requires the integration of multiple related but individual facts.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** Requires simple organization or classification of information.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** Minimal; may involve different branches within the same discipline.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Still relatively concrete, but begins to involve concepts such as categories.
*   **Example:** "List three common types of renewable energy."

## Simple Reasoning (4-6 Points): Single-Step or Simple Multi-Step Reasoning
These questions require a degree of logical thought or the application of knowledge to solve simple problems, typically involving the analysis and application of information.

### 4 Points: Single-Step Application and Calculation
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Requires understanding and applying a specific formula, rule, or method.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** Single or two-step simple logical reasoning or calculation.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** None.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Begins to involve some variables or non-specific contexts.
*   **Example:** "A rectangle has a length of 5 meters and a width of 3 meters. What is its area?"

### 5 Points: Comparison and Contrast
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Requires understanding the similarities and differences between two or more concepts.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** Requires analysis and comparison.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** Limited, usually within the same field.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Involves the analysis of conceptual attributes.
*   **Example:** "Compare and contrast the main differences between a socialist market economy and a capitalist market economy."

### 6 Points: Simple Causal Analysis
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Requires explaining the direct cause behind a phenomenon or its likely consequences.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** Requires a few steps of simple, linear reasoning.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** May involve connecting different knowledge points within the same discipline.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Involves understanding processes and relationships.
*   **Example:** "Why does global warming lead to sea-level rise?"

## Complex Reasoning (7-9 Points): Multi-Step, Multi-Perspective Analysis and Synthesis
These questions typically require drawing upon knowledge from multiple fields, engaging in complex, multi-step reasoning, and understanding abstract concepts.

### 7 Points: Multi-Step Complex Reasoning and Systems Analysis
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Requires a deep understanding of a complex system or theory and the application of its internal logic.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** Requires multi-step, non-linear logical reasoning.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** Often requires combining knowledge from at least two different disciplines.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** High, involving complex theoretical models or abstract concepts.
*   **Example:** "Explain the double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics and how it challenges the concepts of classical physics."

### 8 Points: Evaluation and Critical Thinking
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Requires not only a deep understanding but also the ability to evaluate and weigh different viewpoints or solutions.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** Requires critical analysis, evaluation of pros and cons, and the formation of a judgment.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** Significant, potentially requiring the integration of perspectives from natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** High, involving the application of abstract concepts such as values, standards, and principles.
*   **Example:** "Critique the ethical dilemmas of artificial intelligence in modern society and its potential solutions."

### 9 Points: Synthesis and Innovative Connection
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Demands the establishment of new connections between multiple areas of in-depth knowledge.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** Requires synthesizing information from different sources and engaging in creative and inferential thinking.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** Very high, requiring the establishment of connections between seemingly unrelated fields.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Very high, requiring the manipulation and integration of highly abstract theories and models.
*   **Example:** "How can the principles of game theory be applied to analyze and propose strategies for mitigating international trade disputes?"

## Higher-Order Questions (10 Points): Open-Ended, Creative, and Frontier Exploration
These questions typically have no standard answer and are designed to stimulate creative thinking, explore unknown areas, or solve complex real-world challenges.

### 10 Points: Open-Ended Exploration and Creative Problem-Solving
*   **Knowledge Depth:** Touches upon the frontiers of the current body of knowledge or even unknown territories.
*   **Reasoning Steps:** Requires divergent and creative thinking; may necessitate the design of new research frameworks or solutions.
*   **Interdisciplinary:** Extremely high, demanding a high degree of integration and innovation across multiple fields.
*   **Level of Abstraction:** Extremely high, involving philosophical inquiry, future prediction, or the construction of entirely new theoretical frameworks.
*   **Example:** "How can a sustainable global energy solution be constructed to address climate change and the energy crisis?"
